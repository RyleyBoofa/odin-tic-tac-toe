# Odin Tic Tac Toe

Browser-based Tic Tac Toe game, built as my solution to The Odin Project's [Project: Tic Tac Toe](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-tic-tac-toe). Made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features a clean and responsive interface. Players can enter their names, track their scores across rounds, reset the board, start a new game, and see winning cell combinations highlighted on the grid. This solution is focused on modular design, with clear separation of concerns, resulting in a maintainable, and expandable, codebase.

Live preview can be found [here](https://ryleyboofa.github.io/odin-tic-tac-toe/).

**Key features include:**

-   Two-player local gameplay
-   Player name input via modal dialog
-   Score tracking across rounds
-   Reset and new game functionality
-   Highlighting of winning cells
-   Tie detection and messaging

## Skills used
